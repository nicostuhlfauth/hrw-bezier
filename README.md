## Docs
If you want to create your own project, which rests upon this repository or if you are interested in other ways as well, you may have a look at our [API Docs](https://nicostuhlfauth.github.io/hrw-bezier/docs).

## Build
We used some ES6 features, so if you change anything in `./decasteljau.js` (from root folder), make sure to run `npm run build` afterwards.
